# Random Facts Website

This is a website I created for my SQA Advanced Higher project in my final year of high school. <br />
We used a program called USBWebserver to run the server for our websites. <br />
USBWebserver: [https://www.usbwebserver.net/webserver/](https://www.usbwebserver.net/webserver/)

(had to compress the USBWebserver folder due to it's size, the one in the main directory is for show - another copy inside the zip file)
